# uv completions

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a Python package and project manager, known for its speed.

Though `uv` can generate its Nu completion script via `uv generate-shell-completion`, this script can only
provide static choices, not dynamic choices from _pyproject.toml_ file.

## Install completion script

First, if you installed the script generated by `uv generate-shell-completion`, please remove it to avoid conflict.

### Method 1: Use from Git repo

- `git clone https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts.git`

- Add this to `$nu.config-path` file.

    ```nu
    source repo/custom-completions/uv/uv-completions.nu
    ```

### Method 2: Selectively copy

- Copy the _uv-completions.nu_ to Nu standard place.

    ```nu
    cp custom-completions/uv/uv-completions.nu ($nu.data-dir | path join 'completions')
    ```

- Open `$nu.config-path` file and add this:

    ```nu
    source uv-completions.nu
    ```
